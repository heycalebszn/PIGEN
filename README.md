Version: 1.1
Date: May 7, 2025
1. Introduction
The Project Idea Generator is a web application designed to help individuals, particularly those learning new technical skills or exploring entrepreneurship, find relevant and detailed project or startup ideas to build. Utilizing a conversational interface, similar to a chat, the application will guide users through the idea generation process based on their skills and interests, providing structured information akin to a basic Product Requirements Document (PRD). Users will need to log in via Google to access the service, which includes a daily idea generation limit. The application will also allow users to revisit their previous idea generation conversations.
2. Goals
* To provide learners with practical project ideas that match their current skill set and help them build portfolios, delivered through an intuitive conversational interface.
* To offer aspiring entrepreneurs structured startup ideas that include key business and product considerations, facilitated by a natural dialogue.
* To make the process of finding and understanding project/startup ideas extremely easy and engaging through a conversational flow.
* To empower users to move from having no idea to having a clear, actionable concept with defined features and requirements, supported by interactive Q&A.
* To manage service usage per user through a simple authentication mechanism (Google Login) and a daily generation limit.
* To allow users to revisit and reference their past idea generation sessions.
3. User Personas
* The Skill Explorer (Learner):
    * Motivation: Wants to practice newly acquired skills (e.g., HTML/CSS, a specific programming language or framework) by building real projects. Needs concrete ideas that are challenging but not overwhelming. Appreciates an easy-to-use interface that guides them. Requires easy access via Google login.
    * Needs: Ideas tied to specific technologies, clear feature lists, guidance on project scope, ability to chat about their skills and get tailored suggestions.
    * Frustrations: Generic online tutorials, difficulty coming up with project ideas from scratch, not knowing how to define project requirements, clunky form-based tools.
* The Aspiring Innovator (Entrepreneur):
    * Motivation: Wants to build a startup but is looking for a viable idea or wants to explore different markets. Enjoys exploring ideas through discussion.
    * Needs: Startup ideas with a defined problem, target audience, core features, and potential business model. Benefits from a conversational approach to explore different angles. Requires easy access via Google login.
    * Frustrations: Lack of inspiration, difficulty validating ideas, not knowing how to structure a business idea, static idea lists.
4. User Stories
* As a user, I want to log in easily using my Google account to access the idea generation features.
* As a user, I want to interact with the idea generator through a chat-like interface, asking questions and providing information in a natural way.
* As a Skill Explorer, I want to tell the generator about the programming languages and frameworks I know within the chat so that it suggests projects relevant to my skills.
* As an Aspiring Innovator, I want to chat with the generator about an industry I'm interested in so that it provides startup ideas within that sector.
* As a user, I want the generated idea, presented as a chat response, to include a description of the problem it solves and the target audience so I understand its purpose.
* As a user, I want the generated idea response to list the main features of the project/startup so I know what needs to be built.
* As a user, I want to be able to save the generated ideas directly from the chat conversation so I can revisit them later.
* As a user, I want to be able to view my past conversations with the idea generator so I can recall previous ideas and inputs.
* As a user, I understand there's a daily limit on the number of ideas I can generate through the conversation so that the service remains available for everyone.
* As a user, I want the interface to be simple and easy to navigate, with the chat being the primary mode of interaction.
* As a Skill Explorer, I want the generated project idea response to suggest a possible technology stack so I have guidance on implementation.
* As an Aspiring Innovator, I want the generated startup idea response to suggest potential monetization strategies.
5. Features
* Google Login/Signup:
    * Users must authenticate using their Google account before they can access the idea generation features.
    * This will be a simple "Sign in with Google" button.
    * Upon successful login, a user account will be created or linked internally to track usage and store conversations.
* Conversational Idea Generation Interface:
    * The primary interaction method will be a chat window.
    * The system will initiate the conversation, guiding the user (e.g., "Hi! I can help you find project or startup ideas. What kind of idea are you looking for today?").
    * Users will type their requests or answers into a chat input field.
    * The system will process the input and respond within the chat, potentially asking follow-up questions to refine the idea (e.g., "Okay, a learning project! What technologies are you comfortable with?").
    * The final generated idea, presented as a "Mini-PRD," will be a structured message within the chat conversation.
* Idea Generation Input (within the conversation):
    * Users will provide information about skills, interests, idea type, keywords, complexity level, etc., naturally within the chat flow. The system should be smart enough to parse this information from sentences.
* Idea Generation Limit:
    * Each logged-in user is limited to generating a maximum of 10 distinct ideas (where a distinct idea results in a "Mini-PRD" output) per 24-hour period.
    * The application should display the remaining ideas a user can generate for the day, perhaps subtly within the chat interface or in a sidebar.
    * Once the limit is reached, the system should inform the user within the chat and cease generating new "Mini-PRD" outputs until the limit resets.
* Structured Idea Output (The "Mini-PRD" as a chat response):
    * When a distinct idea is generated, the system will format the output clearly within a chat bubble or a designated area next to the chat.
    * This output will include: Clear Title, Idea Summary/Tagline, Problem Solved, Target Audience, Core Features, Benefit to User/Customer, Suggested Tech Stack (for Learning Projects), Potential Monetization (for Startup Ideas), Potential Challenges, Call to Action/Next Steps.
* Idea Saving (from Conversation):
    * Within the chat interface, provide an easy way to "Save" a specific generated "Mini-PRD" message. This could be an icon or a button associated with that message.
* Conversation History:
    * Provide a dedicated section or sidebar where users can see a list of their past idea generation conversations.
    * Clicking on a past conversation should load the chat history for that specific session.
* User Interface (UI):
    * Conversational Layout: The main area will be a chat window displaying the dialogue between the user and the generator.
    * Clean and Minimalist Design: Focus on simplicity, with the chat interface being the central element.
    * Intuitive Chat Input: A clear input field at the bottom of the chat window.
    * Well-Formatted Output Messages: Ensure the "Mini-PRD" is easy to read within the chat context.
    * Responsive Design: Ensure the application works well on desktop and mobile devices.
    * Prominent Google Login: Make the login option clear upon arrival.
    * Visible Daily Limit: Display the remaining generation count in a non-intrusive way.
    * Easy Access to History: A clear link or icon to navigate to past conversations.
6. User Flow (Basic, Conversation-based)
1. User arrives at the website.
2. User is prompted to "Sign in with Google" to access features.
3. User clicks "Sign in with Google" and completes the Google authentication process.
4. Upon successful login, the user is directed to the main idea generation page, which displays the conversational interface.
5. The system initiates the conversation with a welcome message.
6. User types their request or response in the chat input field.
7. The system processes the input, potentially asks clarifying questions, and responds in the chat.
8. This continues until the system generates a distinct idea (the "Mini-PRD").
9. If the daily limit has not been reached for generating a distinct idea:
    * The "Mini-PRD" is displayed in the chat.
    * The daily generation count is decremented and updated.
    * User can read, copy, or "Save" the idea directly from the chat.
    * The conversation can continue for refinement or a new idea.
10. If the daily limit has been reached when a distinct idea is generated:
    * An informative message is displayed in the chat, and no new "Mini-PRD" is generated.
    * The user can still chat but cannot generate more structured ideas until the limit resets.
11. User can click on a "History" or similar link to view a list of past conversations.
12. User can click on a conversation in the history list to view the full chat transcript.
13. User can start a new conversation to generate a fresh idea (subject to the daily limit).
14. User can log out.
7. Future Enhancements (Potential additions after the initial version)
* Idea Categories/Filtering (within History): Allow users to categorize or filter their saved/past ideas.
* More Sophisticated Conversational AI: Improve the AI's ability to understand complex requests and maintain context.
* Ability to "Fork" a Conversation: Start a new conversation based on a previous one to explore variations of an idea.
* Visual Aids (within chat): Potentially include basic visual concepts for ideas.
* Collaboration Features: Allow users to share specific conversation transcripts or saved ideas.
* Integration with Project Management Tools: Option to export the PRD chat response to tools like Trello, Asana, etc.
* Community Features: Allow users to anonymously share interesting conversation snippets or generated ideas.
* "Build It" Resources (within chat): Contextual links to relevant tutorials or tools based on the conversation.
* Premium Tier: Offer paid plans for increased daily generation limits, advanced AI features, or more extensive history storage.
